# Welcome to the platform for CoNM

CoNM is an end-to-end open source platform for artificial neuronal networks (ANN).
It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ANN and developers easily build and deploy ANN-powered applications. Its particular focus lays on the identification and efficient transfer of knowledge of ANN.

The tool was originally developed by Marcus Grum and will be released when my Ph.D. has been accepted.

## Install

Download a process modeling tool called [Modelangelo](https://lswi.de/expertise/werkzeuge/modelangelo?lang=en).

Include the [NMDL](./meta-models/nmdl/modelangelo) in the modeling tool by copying it to `./templates`.

Start modeling with the NMDL.

## Try your first NMDL program

The Neuronal Modeling and Description Language (NMDL) is a modeling language
that is interpreted by the CoNM tool and enables the communication with and interpretation of ANN.

*   Start the modeling tool.
*   Select `File/New/New Project/` and chose template called `NMDL`.
*   Create models by following the NMDL standard.
*   Let the CoNM platform interpret your models. 

For more examples, see the CoNM tutorials and its reference dissertation shown below.

## Warehouses

The warehouses enable a quick modeling start by providing pre-modeled models. 
Take a look at the [warehouses](./warehouses) as a basis to get started and feel free to extend them.
