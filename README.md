# Welcome to the Platform for CoNM

CoNM is an end-to-end open source platform for artificial neuronal networks (ANN).
It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ANN and developers easily build and deploy ANN-powered applications. Its particular focus lays on the identification and efficient transfer of knowledge of ANN.

The tool was originally developed by Marcus Grum.

## Install 

### ... at Modelangelo

Download the process modeling tool called [Modelangelo](https://lswi.de/expertise/werkzeuge/modelangelo?lang=en).

Include the [NMDL](./meta-models/nmdl/modelangelo) in the modeling tool by copying it to `./templates`.

Start modeling with the NMDL.

### ... at draw.io or diagrams

Download the meta-model from [this repository](./meta-models/nmdl/drawio).

Access the online modeling tool called [diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [draw.io](https://draw.io/) via your browser.

Include the libraries downloaded in the modeling tool via the menu `File/Open library from/Device...` and select the relevant library manually.

## Try your first NMDL program...

The Neuronal Modeling and Description Language (NMDL) is a modeling language
that is interpreted by the CoNM tool and enables the communication with and interpretation of ANN.

### ...using Modelangelo

*   Start the modeling tool.
*   Select `File/New.../Blank Diagram/` and just start modeling by dragging items from the template called `NMDL`.
*   Create models by following the NMDL standard.
*   Let the CoNM platform interpret your models. 

For more examples, see the CoNM [tutorials](./tutorials) and its reference dissertation shown below.

### ...using diagrams.net or draw.io

*   Start the modeling tool via the browser.
*   Select `File/New/New Project/` and chose template called `NMDL`.
*   Create models by following the NMDL standard.
*   Let the CoNM platform interpret your models. 

## Warehouses

The warehouses enable a quick modeling start by providing pre-modeled models. 
Take a look at the [warehouses](./warehouses) as a basis to get started and feel free to extend them.
