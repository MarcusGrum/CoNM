CoNM is an end-to-end open source platform for artificial neuronal networks (ANN).
It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ANN and developers easily build and deploy ANN-powered applications. Its particular focus lays on the identification and efficient transfer of knowledge of ANN.

The tool was originally developed by Marcus Grum and will be released when my Ph.D. has been accepted.

## Install
